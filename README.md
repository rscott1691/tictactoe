# tictactoe
Simple tic-tac-toe game to play in a console

To play the game, simply run the play_game() function in the console. The game will prompt the two players to enter their moves in turn, and will print out the board after each move. Once the game is over, it will print out the winner (if there is one) or indicate that the game ended in a draw.
